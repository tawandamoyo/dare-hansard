# Introduction

This application tracks parliamentary activity in the Zimbabwean Parliament. In particular, it scrapes the Parliament website for the official records of Parliament proceedings called the Hansard and parses the PDFs into transcripts assigned to the responsible Member of Parliament. Features include the ability search for specific MPs, or via keywords, and to perform analysis on the proceedings. 

This project is inspired, and borrows from, They Work for You.
